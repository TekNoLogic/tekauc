tekauc is a basic auction price tracker.  tekauc tracks min/max/count for all items currently on the AH and provides for fast posting based on the min prices.  tekauc <b>does not</b> keep price history.

h2. tekauc ~= AuctioneerAdvanced

Don't get me wrong, I love AucAdv.  If it does what you want, please use it, it is a very good addon.  I wrote tekauc because I realized that all the work AucAdv was doing to get my the "average" price was a waste of time due to my settings.  I had AucAdv adjusted so that it was undercutting the lowest price in nearly all cases.  It wasn't worth maintaining all that price history when all I really cared about was the current lowest priced auction.  Thus tekauc was born of that need.

Let me say that again for you all.  I think AucAdv is a very good addon.  You should give it a try before you try mine, because mine is designed with one very speceific use-case in mind... mine!
